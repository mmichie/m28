# List Syntax Fix

## Issue

When attempting to use comma-separated list literals in the M28 language REPL, issues occur with variable assignment and scoping. For example:

```lisp
In [1]: (= a [1,2,3])
RuntimeError: undefined symbol: a (did you mean: if, and, or?) (did you forget to define the variable or import a module?)

In [1]: (= a 1)  # Works fine
Out[1]:  1
```

## Analysis

After investigation, we found the following:

1. The tokenizer correctly recognizes both space-separated and comma-separated list syntax
2. The parser handles both formats in file mode correctly
3. There appears to be a scoping issue in the REPL when using `=` with complex types like lists

The problem is likely in the evaluator's handling of variable assignments in the REPL environment rather than in the parser's handling of list syntax.

## Recommended Solution

1. Ensure the REPL environment correctly tracks variable assignments
2. Review the evaluator code that handles the `=` special form to ensure it properly updates variables in the REPL environment
3. Consider modifying the REPL's execution model to maintain consistent scope across expressions

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Run the REPL in debug mode
2. Execute `(= a [1,2,3])` and verify assignment
3. Execute `(println a)` to verify variable access
4. Execute `(= b [1, 2, 3])` with spaces after commas
5. Try with nested lists and other complex types

This should ensure proper handling of comma-separated lists in all contexts.
