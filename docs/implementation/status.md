### Partially Implemented

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Object System | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Uses closure-based approach instead of Python-like class syntax |
| Dot Notation | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Property and method access works, but with some limitations |
| Exception Handling | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Basic functionality works, but missing advanced features |
| List Comprehensions | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Supported but with slight syntax differences |
| Module System | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Basic functionality works, missing advanced features |

### Planned Features

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Class System | üîÑ Planned | Class definition with inheritance |
| Context Managers | üîÑ Planned | `with` statement for resource management |
| Generators | üîÑ Planned | `yield` for creating iterators |
| Async/Await | üîÑ Planned | Support for asynchronous programming |
| Extended Standard Library | üîÑ Planned | More built-in functions and utilities |
| Tail Call Optimization | üîÑ Planned | For efficient recursion |

## Implementation Details

### Object System

The current implementation uses a dictionary and closure-based approach for objects:

```lisp
; Current implementation pattern
(def (make-dog name)
  (= dog-name name)
  (= dog-obj (dict))
  (def (bark)
    (print (+ dog-name " says Woof!")))
  (= dog-obj (dict "name" dog-name "bark" bark))
  dog-obj)
```

Future plans include adding syntactic sugar for a more Python-like class definition:

```lisp
; Planned class syntax
(class Dog ()
  (def (init self name)
    (= self.name name))
  (def (bark self)
    (print (+ self.name " says Woof!"))))
```

### Exception Handling

Basic exception handling is implemented, but with limited support for complex exception hierarchies:

```lisp
; Current implementation
(try
  (/ 10 0)
  (except ZeroDivisionError
    (print "Cannot divide by zero")))
```

Future enhancements will include:
- Full exception type hierarchy
- Custom exception types
- Better traceback information

### Module System

The current module system supports basic imports:

```lisp
(import "module_name")
(module_name.function arg1 arg2)
```

Planned enhancements:
- Selective imports (`from module import symbol`)
- Aliased imports (`import module as alias`)
- Relative imports
- Package directory structure

## Performance Considerations

The current M28 implementation focuses on correctness rather than performance. Future versions will address:

1. Tail call optimization for recursive functions
2. Bytecode compilation
3. Memory usage optimization
4. Faster dictionary and lookup operations

## Compatibility Notes

M28 aims to provide a balance between Lisp's expressiveness and Python's readability. This leads to some design choices that differ from both languages:

1. **Mutable Default Arguments**: Unlike Python, M28 doesn't have issues with mutable default arguments
2. **First-class Functions**: All functions are first-class values
3. **Method Calls**: Methods require passing the object as first argument
4. **No Implicit Return**: The last expression in a function is not automatically returned (use explicit `return`)
