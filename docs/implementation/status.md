## Implementation Details

### Object System

The current implementation uses a dictionary and closure-based approach for objects:

```lisp
; Current implementation pattern
(def (make-dog name)
  (= dog-name name)
  (= dog-obj (dict))
  (def (bark)
    (print (+ dog-name " says Woof!")))
  (= dog-obj (dict "name" dog-name "bark" bark))
  dog-obj)
```

Future plans include adding syntactic sugar for a more Python-like class definition:

```lisp
; Planned class syntax
(class Dog ()
  (def (init self name)
    (= self.name name))
  (def (bark self)
    (print (+ self.name " says Woof!"))))
```

### Exception Handling

Exception handling is implemented with support for exception types and basic handling:

```lisp
; Current implementation
(try
  (/ 10 0)
  (except ZeroDivisionError
    (print "Cannot divide by zero")))

; Exception with variable binding
(try
  (/ 10 0)
  (except ZeroDivisionError as err
    (print "Error:" err)))
```

Enhancements needed:
- Better traceback information
- Improved exception propagation
- More comprehensive error messages

### Context Managers

Context managers are implemented via the `with` statement:

```lisp
; File operations with context manager
(with (open "test.txt" "w") as file
  (file.write "Hello, World!"))
```

Implementation includes:
- Context manager protocol (`__enter__` and `__exit__` methods)
- File context manager in `core/context_manager.go`
- Example usage in `examples/advanced/context_managers.m28`

### Generators

Basic generator functionality is implemented:

```lisp
; Simple generator function
(def (count-up-to n)
  (= i 0)
  (while (< i n)
    (yield i)
    (= i (+ i 1))))

; Using the generator
(for x (count-up-to 5)
  (print x))
```

Implementation includes:
- `yield` statement in `core/generator.go`
- Generator protocol
- Basic iteration support

### Module System

The current module system supports basic imports:

```lisp
(import "module_name")
(module_name.function arg1 arg2)
```

Planned enhancements:
- Selective imports (`from module import symbol`)
- Aliased imports (`import module as alias`)
- Relative imports
- Package directory structure

## Performance Considerations

While tail call optimization has been implemented, other performance improvements are still needed:

1. More extensive testing of recursive functions
2. Memory usage optimization
3. Faster dictionary and lookup operations
4. General interpreter performance improvements

## Compatibility Notes

M28 aims to provide a balance between Lisp's expressiveness and Python's readability. This leads to some design choices that differ from both languages:

1. **Mutable Default Arguments**: Unlike Python, M28 doesn't have issues with mutable default arguments
2. **First-class Functions**: All functions are first-class values
3. **Method Calls**: Methods require passing the object as first argument
4. **No Implicit Return**: The last expression in a function is not automatically returned (use explicit `return`)
