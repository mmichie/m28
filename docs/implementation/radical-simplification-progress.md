# Radical Simplification Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of the M28 radical simplification plan as outlined in the roadmap.

## Overall Progress

**Current Status**: Phase 1, Week 2 - Object Protocol Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETE

## Phase 1: Core Type System (2 weeks)

### Week 1: Value Interface & Primitive Types ‚úÖ COMPLETE

  - ‚úÖ Value interface with Type() and String() methods
  - ‚úÖ Type constants defined
- [x] **Days 3-4**: Implement primitive types
  - ‚úÖ `NumberValue` for numeric data
  - ‚úÖ `StringValue` for text
  - ‚úÖ `BoolValue` for boolean logic (Python-style True/False)
  - ‚úÖ `SymbolValue` for identifiers
  - ‚úÖ `NilValue` for null/None (Python-style None)
- [x] **Day 5**: Implement value equality, conversion, and string representation
  - ‚úÖ String representations implemented
  - ‚úÖ Python-style type conversion functions (int, str, bool)
  - ‚úÖ Type checking with isinstance()

### Week 2: Object Protocol Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] **Days 1-2**: Implement the `BaseObject` with standard attribute handling
  - ‚úÖ BaseObject struct with attrs map and thread-safe access
  - ‚úÖ GetAttr, SetAttr methods
  - ‚úÖ Object interface defined
- [x] **Days 3-4**: Develop `TypeDescriptor` system for type metadata
  - ‚úÖ TypeDescriptor struct with methods, properties, constructor
  - ‚úÖ MethodDescriptor and PropertyDescriptor
  - ‚úÖ Global type registry
  - ‚úÖ All primitive types registered with descriptors
  - ‚úÖ Introspection functions: type(), dir(), hasattr(), getattr()
- [x] **Day 5**: Build method binding and callable interfaces
  - ‚úÖ Callable interface implemented
  - ‚úÖ Method interface with Bind()
  - ‚úÖ BoundMethod type for automatic binding
  - ‚úÖ BuiltinFunction and BuiltinMethod types

## Phase 2: Evaluation Engine (2 weeks) üöß IN PROGRESS

### Week 1: Context & Core Evaluation
- [x] **Days 1-2**: Implement `Context` structure with variable environment
  - ‚úÖ Context with variable scoping
  - ‚úÖ Define, Set, Lookup methods
  - ‚úÖ Global context support
- [ ] **Days 3-4**: Create basic `Eval` function with expression dispatch
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic Eval exists but needs updates for new architecture
- [ ] **Day 5**: Add error handling with proper stack traces
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic error handling exists, needs improvement

### Week 2: Special Forms
- [x] **Day 1**: Implement basic control flow (`if`, `cond`)
  - ‚úÖ if form implemented
- [x] **Day 2**: Add variable definition and assignment forms
  - ‚úÖ def form implemented
  - ‚úÖ = assignment form implemented
- [ ] **Day 3**: Implement function definition and lambda forms
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially implemented, needs update
- [ ] **Day 4**: Add looping constructs (`for`, `while`, `loop`)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Exists but needs verification with new system
- [ ] **Day 5**: Implement exception handling (`try`, `except`, `finally`)
  - ‚ùå Not yet implemented in new system

## Phase 3: Collections & Standard Library (1.5 weeks)

### Week 1: Collections
- [ ] **Days 1-2**: Implement `List` with the new object protocol
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic ListValue exists, needs full object protocol
- [ ] **Days 3-4**: Create `Dict` implementation with standard methods
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic dict exists, needs object protocol
- [ ] **Day 5**: Add `Tuple` and `Set` implementations
  - ‚ùå Not yet implemented

### Days 1-3 of Week 2: Standard Library
- [ ] **Day 1**: Add mathematical functions
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic arithmetic exists
- [ ] **Day 2**: Implement string manipulation functions
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Some string functions exist
- [ ] **Day 3**: Create core utility functions
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Some utilities exist

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (1.5 weeks)

### Days 4-5 of Week 2 & Week 3: Advanced Language Features
- [ ] **Day 4**: Implement module system with import/export
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic import exists
- [ ] **Day 5**: Build enhanced class system with inheritance
  - ‚ùå Not yet implemented
- [ ] **Day 1**: Add generator support with yield
  - ‚ùå Not yet implemented
- [ ] **Day 2**: Implement context managers
  - ‚ùå Not yet implemented
- [ ] **Day 3**: Create concurrency features (go, channels, select)
  - ‚ùå Removed in simplification
- [ ] **Days 4-5**: Build REPL and file execution system
  - ‚úÖ Basic REPL and file execution work

## Phase 5: Testing & Optimization (1 week)

- [ ] **Days 1-2**: Port existing tests to validate new implementation
- [ ] **Day 3**: Create new tests for previously untested features
- [ ] **Day 4**: Performance optimization and benchmarking
- [ ] **Day 5**: Final validation and documentation

## Key Achievements So Far

1. **Complete primitive type system** with Python-style syntax
2. **Full TypeDescriptor system** for runtime introspection
3. **Method binding** works automatically
4. **Python-style naming** throughout (True/False, None, etc.)
5. **Basic evaluation** and special forms working
6. **Assignment operator** (=) fixed and working

## Next Steps

1. Update evaluator to fully use new Value interface
2. Port special forms to new architecture
3. Implement collections with full Object protocol
4. Add remaining standard library functions

## Notes

- The concurrency features have been intentionally removed as part of the simplification
- Focus is on clean, simple implementation over features
- Python compatibility is prioritized in naming and behavior
