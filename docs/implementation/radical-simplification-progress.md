## Phase 3 Summary

Phase 3 is now complete! We've successfully implemented:

**Collections (Week 1):**

## Next Steps

Begin Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Implement module system with import/export (Day 4)
2. Build enhanced class system with inheritance (Day 5)
3. Add generator support with yield (Week 3, Day 1)
4. Implement context managers (Week 3, Day 2)
5. Finalize REPL and file execution improvements (Week 3, Days 4-5)

## Notes

- The concurrency features have been intentionally removed as part of the simplification
- Focus is on clean, simple implementation over features
- Python compatibility is prioritized in naming and behavior
