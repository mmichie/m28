# M28 Language Implementation Roadmap

> **NOTE**: This document has been superseded by the comprehensive implementation roadmap in `/docs/specification/implementation-roadmap.md`. Please refer to that document for the most up-to-date development plan. This file is maintained for historical purposes and to track previously completed features.

## Implementation Status

This section tracks the current implementation status of various M28 features.

### Implementation Legend
- ✅ Feature implemented
- ⚠️ Feature partial, in progress, or needs improvement
- ❌ Feature not implemented

## Completed Features

- ✅ Basic syntax and expression parsing
- ✅ Python-style dictionary literals (`{"key": value}`)
- ✅ Dictionary functions (get, dict) and operations
- ✅ Keyword arguments for functions via dictionaries
- ✅ Basic arithmetic and comparison operations
- ✅ Variable assignment with `=`
- ✅ Function definition with `def`
- ✅ Basic control flow (if, for, while)
- ✅ List operations and manipulation
- ✅ Basic modules and import functionality
- ✅ Enhanced module imports (aliased, multi-symbol, wildcard)
- ✅ Dot notation for property and method access
- ✅ Exception handling with try/except
- ✅ Object representation via closures
- ✅ Tail call optimization for recursion
- ✅ Context managers with with/as syntax
- ✅ Generators with yield statement
- ✅ Basic exception hierarchy
- ✅ Module-level `__exports__` mechanism
- ✅ REPL improvements (line editing, history, tab completion)
- ✅ Error message enhancements

## Features In Progress

### High Priority

- ⚠️ Enhance break/continue reliability in loops
- ⚠️ Improve support for early returns in functions
- ⚠️ Further optimize stack management for deep recursion
- ⚠️ Fix consistency issues in module symbol resolution
- ⚠️ Add namespace introspection utilities
- ⚠️ Create an import hook system for extensibility
- ⚠️ Implement missing Python-equivalent built-in functions
- ⚠️ Enhance list operations (slicing, comprehensions)
- ⚠️ Improve set operations (union, intersection, etc.)
- ⚠️ Enhance tuple implementation

### Medium Priority

- ⚠️ Implement new [Unified Object Protocol](./unified-object-protocol.md)
- ⚠️ Refactor type system to use single coherent interface
- ⚠️ Add syntactic sugar for class definitions
- ⚠️ Add support for class inheritance
- ⚠️ Add support for package directories (with `__init__.m28` files)
- ⚠️ Add more built-in context managers for common resources
- ⚠️ Improve generator expression support

### Low Priority

- ⚠️ Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
- ⚠️ Make module search paths configurable
- ⚠️ Add 'async/await' syntax
- ⚠️ Add optional type hints
- ⚠️ Implement macros for syntax extension

## New Direction

Based on the new language specification and implementation roadmap, the following enhancements are planned:

1. **Updated Language Semantics**
   - Single comment style using `#` only
   - Restricting `def` to function definitions only
   - Pythonic type checking with `isinstance()` and `type()`

2. **Concurrency Model**
   - Goroutine-based concurrency with the `go` statement
   - Channel-based communication
   - Select statement for multiplexing
   - Synchronization primitives

3. **Object System Overhaul**
   - Unified Object Protocol
   - Enhanced class system with inheritance
   - Improved method dispatch
   - Better property access

- [Implementation Roadmap](/docs/specification/implementation-roadmap.md)
- [Testing Strategy](/docs/specification/test-strategy.md)

## Design Principles

The M28 development is guided by these core principles:

1. **Simplicity**: Keep the implementation simple and maintainable
2. **Pythonic**: Follow Python's conventions where appropriate
3. **Lisp-compatible**: Maintain compatibility with Lisp-style code
4. **Robust**: Include comprehensive error handling
5. **Extensible**: Design for future enhancements
