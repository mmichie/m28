# Dot Notation Implementation Status

## Overview

This document describes the current status of the dot notation implementation for method and property access in the M28 language. Dot notation allows for more Pythonic syntax when accessing object properties and methods.

## Current Implementation

1. **Special Form Registration**: 
   - Added the `.` special form to the list of special forms
   - Implemented `EvalDot` function to handle property access and method calls

2. **Evaluator Support**:
   - Added support in the evaluator for the dot notation special form
   - Implemented property access for dictionary objects
   - Added method call support with self parameter injection
   - Added support for generator methods

3. **Parser Modifications**:
   - Started implementing parser support for dot notation syntax
   - Added token processing for the dot operator

## Remaining Work

1. **Parser Enhancement**:
   - The current parser has issues handling the dot notation syntax
   - Need to fix the parser to properly transform `object.method` into `(. object "method")`
   - Need to handle nested property access (e.g., `object.property.method`)

2. **Dot Notation Transformation**:
   - Need to complete the implementation of dot notation transformation in the parser
   - Update the tokenizer to handle dot notation consistently

3. **Dictionary Access**:
   - Fix property access for dictionary objects
   - Ensure proper error handling for missing properties

4. **Testing**:
   - Create comprehensive tests for all aspects of dot notation
   - Test property access, method calls, and nested property access
   - Test with different object types (dictionaries, lambdas, generators)

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update main documentation to include dot notation syntax
   - Add examples of dot notation usage
   - Document implementation details for future maintenance

## Implementation Plan

1. First, fix the parser to correctly handle dot notation
2. Then update the evaluator to process dot notation expressions
3. Add test cases for each feature
4. Finally, update documentation with examples and usage guidelines

## Conclusion

The dot notation feature is partially implemented but needs additional work to fully function as expected. The special form and basic evaluation are in place, but parser support needs improvement to handle the syntax correctly.

Once completed, this feature will greatly improve the Pythonic nature of the language by providing more intuitive syntax for object property and method access.
