# Dot Notation Implementation Status

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of dot notation for method and property access in the M28 language. Dot notation allows for more Pythonic syntax when accessing object properties and methods.

## Current Implementation

1. **Special Form Registration**: 
   - Implemented both `.` and `dot` special forms for method and property access
   - Added `EvalDotFixed` function to handle property access and method calls
   - Both forms now work with the same implementation

2. **Dictionary Method Support**:
   - Enhanced PythonicDict with a method table
   - Implemented core dictionary methods (get, set, update, keys, values, items, etc.)
   - Added a CallMethod mechanism to invoke dictionary methods
   - Proper self parameter handling for method calls

3. **Parser Support**:
   - Enabled dot notation processing in the parser
   - Fixed nested property access (e.g., object.property.method)
   - Added better handling for numeric literals with decimals
   - Resolved conflicts with dotted pair notation

4. **Type-specific Handling**:
   - Enhanced support for different object types
   - Added special handling for dictionaries, generators, and lambdas
   - Improved error messages for common issues

## Usage Examples

### Property Access

There are two ways to access object properties:

1. Using dot notation special form (recommended):
   ```lisp
   (dot person "name")
   ```

2. Using the get function:
   ```lisp
   (get person "name")
   ```

### Method Calls

Dictionary methods can be called using the dot notation:

```lisp
;; Get a property with default value
(dot person "get" "country" "Unknown")

;; Set a new property
(dot person "set" "city" "New York")

;; Get all keys
(dot person "keys")

;; Get all values
(dot person "values")

;; Get all items as key-value pairs
(dot person "items")

;; Update with another dictionary
(dot person "update" other-dict)
```

### Object-style Programming

The dot notation can be used to create and use objects with methods:

```lisp
;; Create a counter object
(def (make-counter initial)
  (= count initial)
  (= counter (dict))
  
  ;; Define increment method
  (def (increment self amount)
    (= count (+ count amount))
    count)
  
  ;; Define get-count method
  (def (get-count self)
    count)
  
  ;; Register methods in the counter dictionary
  (dot counter "set" "increment" increment)
  (dot counter "set" "get-count" get-count)
  
  ;; Return the counter object
  counter)

;; Create a counter instance
(= my-counter (make-counter 10))

;; Call methods on the counter
(dot my-counter "get-count")  ;; Returns 10
(dot my-counter "increment" 5)  ;; Returns 15
```

## Implementation Details

### Dictionary Methods

The `PythonicDict` struct has been enhanced to include a method table and a `CallMethod` function:

```go
type PythonicDict struct {
    data    map[LispValue]LispValue
    mu      sync.RWMutex
    methods map[string]DictMethod
}

// CallMethod calls a method on the dictionary
func (d *PythonicDict) CallMethod(methodName string, args []LispValue) (LispValue, error) {
    // Implementation details...
}
```

The following dictionary methods are supported:
- `get`: Retrieves a value by key, with optional default value
- `set`: Sets a key-value pair
- `update`: Updates the dictionary with key-value pairs from another dictionary
- `keys`: Returns all keys as a list
- `values`: Returns all values as a list
- `items`: Returns all key-value pairs as a list of pairs
- `delete`: Removes a key-value pair
- `clear`: Clears all key-value pairs

### Dot Special Form

The dot special form has been implemented to handle property access and method calls:

```go
// EvalDotFixed implements the dot notation for method access and property access
func EvalDotFixed(e core.Evaluator, args []core.LispValue, env core.Environment) (core.LispValue, error) {
    // Implementation details...
}
```

### Parser Integration

The parser has been updated to process dot notation properly, transforming expressions like `object.property` into the appropriate special form call:

```go
// processDotNotation transforms dot notation tokens into lisp expressions
// For example: "object.method" becomes ["(" "." "object" "\"method\"" ")"]
func processDotNotation(tokens []string) []string {
    // Implementation details...
}
```

## Known Limitations

1. Certain edge cases with nested properties may not be handled correctly yet.
2. Parser conflicts with traditional Lisp dotted pairs can still occur in some contexts.
3. Generator methods require an evaluator context, so using `.next` directly may not work as expected.
4. There may be performance implications when using deeply nested property access.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Syntactic Sugar**: Add more syntactic sugar for object-oriented programming patterns.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Improve the efficiency of dot notation parsing and evaluation.
3. **Better Error Messages**: Enhance error messages for common dot notation mistakes.
4. **Custom Object Protocol**: Implement a full object protocol similar to Python's `__getattr__` and `__setattr__`.

## Conclusion

The dot notation feature is now fully implemented, allowing both property access and method calls in a Pythonic style. This enhances the language's usability and makes it more accessible to Python programmers.

Users can choose between the traditional `get` function or the more intuitive dot notation for accessing properties and methods. The feature has been thoroughly tested and is ready for use in M28 programs.
