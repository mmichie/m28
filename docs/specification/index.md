# M28 Language Specification

This directory contains the official specification, implementation roadmap, and testing strategy for the M28 language.

## Core Documents

- [**Language Specification**](language-specification.md) - Complete language definition and semantics
- [**Implementation Roadmap**](implementation-roadmap.md) - Development plan and timeline 
- [**Testing Strategy**](test-strategy.md) - Approach to testing the language implementation

## Document Status

These documents represent the source of truth for M28 development. They supersede any conflicting information in other documentation files. All future development should be guided by these specifications.

## Migration Status

We are in the process of migrating information from older documentation into these specification documents. The goal is to have a single, coherent set of documents that fully describe the M28 language.
