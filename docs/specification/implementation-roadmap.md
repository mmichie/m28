# M28 Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the implementation plan for the M28 language based on the language specification. It provides a structured approach to developing, testing, and releasing the language features described in the specification.

## 1. Development Philosophy

### 1.1 Guiding Principles

1. **Specification-Driven Development**: Implementation follows the language specification.
2. **Test-First Approach**: Tests are written before implementing features.
3. **Incremental Development**: Features are developed in small, manageable increments.
4. **Continuous Integration**: Changes are integrated and tested frequently.
5. **Documentation Alongside Code**: Documentation is updated as features are implemented.

### 1.2 Development Workflow

1. **Specification**: Define the feature in the language specification.
2. **Test Development**: Write tests that verify the feature works as specified.
3. **Implementation**: Implement the feature according to the specification.
4. **Validation**: Verify the implementation passes the tests.
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation with examples and explanations.
6. **Release**: Include the feature in a release.
