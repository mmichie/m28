# Object Protocol Implementation in M28

## Implementation Overview

We have implemented a unified Object Protocol system in M28 that provides a consistent
interface for property access and method invocation across different object types.

## Key Components

### 1. Core Interfaces

- **ObjProtocol** (`core/obj_protocol.go`): Defines the core property access and method call interface
- **AdaptableLispValue**: Interface for types that can adapt to ObjProtocol
- **Helper Functions**: GetPropFrom, SetPropOn, etc. for working with objects
- **Direct Access**: DirectGetProp and DirectSetProp for optimized property access

### 2. Type Adapters

- **ClassAdapter**: Adapts PythonicClass to the Object Protocol
- **ObjectAdapter**: Adapts PythonicObject instances
- **DictAdapter**: Provides object-like interface for dictionaries
- **Other Adapters**: Handles other types like modules and generators

### 3. Enhanced Access

- **EnhancedObjectMember**: Unified function for accessing object members
- **EnhancedSetObjectMember**: Unified function for setting object properties
- **Special Forms**: Updated dot.go for dot notation handling

## Recommended Usage Patterns

Based on our implementation experience, the most reliable patterns for property access are:

### 1. Using dict.get/dict.set

```lisp
(dict.get obj "property")
(dict.set obj "property" value)
```

### 2. Helper Function Pattern

```lisp
(def (get-prop obj name)
  (dict.get obj name))

(def (set-prop obj name value)
  (dict.set obj name value)
  value)
```

### 3. Class Methods with Properties

```lisp
(class MyClass ()
  (def (init self name)
    (dict.set self "name" name))
    
  (def (get-name self)
    (dict.get self "name"))
)
```

## Implementation Challenges

During implementation, we encountered some challenges:

1. **Dot Notation Complexity**: Handling nested property access with dot notation
2. **Class Constructor Issues**: Ensuring constructors work reliably
3. **Interface Compatibility**: Maintaining compatibility with existing types

## Current Status

The Object Protocol is implemented and works for most cases, though there are some
limitations with direct property access syntax (using dot notation). The core access
patterns using dict.get/dict.set are working well and provide a clean, consistent interface
for property access.

## Future Work

1. **Refine Dot Notation**: Enhance the dot notation handling for property access
2. **Extend Protocol Support**: Add more types to the protocol
3. **Optimize Direct Access**: Make property access faster and more direct
4. **Add More Examples**: Add comprehensive examples showing different patterns

## Summary

The unified Object Protocol provides a solid foundation for consistent property access
in M28. Although the direct property access with dot notation has limitations, the
dict.get/dict.set patterns work reliably and should be used for consistent access.
