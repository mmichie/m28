# M28 Language Verification Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive approach to achieve high confidence in the M28 language implementation. It defines a systematic process for verifying that the implementation accurately reflects the language specification.

## Verification Framework

### 1. Specification-Driven Testing

All language features must be tested against the formal language specification:

- **Each section** of the specification should have corresponding tests
- **Every feature** must have both positive and negative tests
- **Edge cases** must be explicitly tested
- **Error conditions** must be verified to produce correct error types and messages

### 2. Test Coverage Metrics

We establish the following coverage targets:

- **Line coverage**: >90% for core implementation files
- **Branch coverage**: >85% for control structures
- **Feature coverage**: 100% of specified features must have dedicated tests

### 3. Test Categories

Our verification strategy uses the following categories of tests:

#### a. Unit Tests
- Test individual components of the interpreter
- Focus on parser, evaluator, and type system correctness

#### b. Feature Tests
- Test specific language features across components
- Verify compliance with the specification

#### c. Integration Tests
- Test interactions between language features
- Ensure features work correctly in combination

#### d. Conformance Tests
- Verify compliance with the language specification
- Organized by specification section

#### e. Performance Tests
- Measure and track interpreter performance
- Verify computational complexity expectations

#### f. Concurrency Tests
- Verify correct behavior in concurrent contexts
- Test for race conditions and deadlocks

## Implementation Verification Plan

### Phase 1: Core Language Validation

1. **Type System Validation**
   - Implement comprehensive tests for all data types (primitives, collections, callables)
   - Verify type checking mechanisms (`isinstance`, `issubclass`)
   - Test type conversion functions and coercion rules
   - Test operator behavior for each type

2. **Control Flow Verification**
   - Test conditional expressions (if/else, pattern matching)
   - Verify iteration constructs (for, while, comprehensions)
   - Test exception handling mechanism
   - Verify tail call optimization

3. **Function and Closure Validation**
   - Test function definition and calling conventions
   - Verify closure behavior and lexical scoping
   - Test recursion with deep call stacks
   - Verify first-class function behavior

### Phase 2: Object System Validation

1. **Object Protocol Testing**
   - Test attribute access mechanisms
   - Verify method dispatch rules
   - Test inheritance relationships
   - Verify protocol objects implementation (iterators, containers, etc.)

2. **Class System Verification**
   - Test class definition and instantiation
   - Verify inheritance mechanism
   - Test method overriding
   - Verify super method access

### Phase 3: Advanced Feature Validation

1. **Generators and Coroutines**
   - Test basic generator functions
   - Verify yield statement behavior
   - Test generator methods
   - Verify asynchronous programming features (if implemented)

2. **Context Managers**
   - Test context manager protocol
   - Verify resource cleanup
   - Test exception handling within context managers
   - Test built-in context managers

3. **Concurrency Model**
   - Test goroutine creation and execution
   - Verify channel communication
   - Test select statement behavior
   - Verify synchronization primitives
   - Test advanced concurrency patterns

### Phase 4: Module System Validation

1. **Module Import Mechanism**
   - Test basic import functionality
   - Verify module resolution algorithm
   - Test circular import handling
   - Verify namespace management

2. **Standard Library Verification**
   - Test all built-in functions
   - Verify standard module behavior
   - Test I/O operations
   - Verify higher-order functions

### Phase 5: Performance Validation

1. **Computational Complexity Verification**
   - Measure performance of standard operations
   - Verify collection method complexity
   - Test algorithm efficiency

2. **Memory Management Validation**
   - Test garbage collection behavior
   - Verify resource lifecycle
   - Measure memory efficiency
   - Test for memory leaks

## Testing Tools and Infrastructure

We will use the following tools and approaches:

1. **Automated Test Runner**
   - Run tests in CI/CD pipeline
   - Generate coverage reports
   - Track performance metrics over time

2. **Property-Based Testing**
   - Generate random inputs to test properties of functions
   - Verify invariants hold for random inputs

3. **Fuzz Testing**
   - Test interpreter with randomly generated programs
   - Identify crashes and unexpected behavior

4. **Benchmark Suite**
   - Measure performance of key operations
   - Compare against baseline metrics
   - Track performance regressions

## Continuous Verification

To maintain confidence in the implementation:

1. **Regression Testing**
   - Run all tests on every change
   - Add regression tests for all bug fixes
   - Track test coverage metrics over time

2. **Specification Updates**
   - Update tests when the specification changes
   - Verify that implementation matches updated specification
   - Document discrepancies between implementation and specification

3. **Community Testing**
   - Encourage community contributions to the test suite
   - Collect real-world usage examples
   - Add tests for reported issues

## Conclusion

By following this verification plan, we can achieve high confidence in the M28 language implementation. The plan ensures that all aspects of the language are thoroughly tested, from core features to advanced functionality. Implementation status should be regularly updated to reflect the current state of verification.
