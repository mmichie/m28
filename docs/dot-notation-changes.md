# Dot Notation Enhancements

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the dot notation implementation in M28.

## Summary of Changes

1. **Defined DotAccessible Interface**
   - Created a standardized interface in `core/types.go` for objects that support dot notation
   - Ensured consistent property access and method calling across different object types
   - Interface methods: HasProperty, GetProperty, SetProperty, HasMethod, CallMethod

2. **Updated PythonicDict Implementation**
   - Made dictionaries implement the DotAccessible interface
   - Ensured compatibility with existing Get/Set methods
   - Added method support for dictionaries

3. **Revised Evaluator for Symbol-Based Dot Notation**
   - Updated the evaluator to use DotAccessible interface for symbol-based dot notation (obj.prop)
   - Improved handling of nested property access
   - Enhanced method reference creation

4. **Updated Functional Dot Notation**
   - Updated dot_fixed.go to use the DotAccessible interface
   - Added support for multi-level property access in a single expression
   - Improved error handling and reporting

5. **Enhanced Module Dot Handlers**
   - Added support for method calls in module dot handlers
   - Improved property access for module attributes
   - Enhanced error reporting for module property access

6. **Added Nested Property Access Support**
   - Implemented support for traversing deeply nested properties
   - Added error handling for each level of property access
   - Enhanced error messages for nested property access failures

7. **Standardized Error Messages**
   - Created consistent error message templates in `core/dot_errors.go`
   - Added helper functions for common error types
   - Improved error diagnostics across all dot notation operations

8. **Added Comprehensive Test Cases**
   - Created `tests/dot-notation-test.m28` with tests for various dot notation scenarios
   - Tested dictionaries, modules, and custom objects
   - Verified property access, method calls, and nested access

9. **Improved Documentation**
   - Added detailed documentation on dot notation usage in `docs/dot-notation-examples.md`
   - Documented implementation details in `docs/dot-notation-implementation.md`
   - Provided examples for different object types and use cases

10. **Clean Implementation**
    - Created a clean version of the dot notation implementation in `special_forms/dot_clean.go`
    - Removed excessive debug statements
    - Maintained full functionality while improving code clarity

## Effect on User Code

These changes should be fully backward compatible with existing code, while providing the following benefits:

1. More consistent behavior for dot notation across different object types
2. Better error messages when dot notation operations fail
3. Support for more advanced patterns like nested property access
4. Clearer documentation and examples for effective usage

## Future Work

Future improvements to consider:

1. True bound method support (auto-binding `self` parameter)
2. Operator overloading via dot notation
3. Adding DotAccessible to more core types (strings, lists, etc.)
4. Performance optimizations for deeply nested property access
