# Compare slice behavior with Python

(= lst [0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5])

# In Python:
# lst[5:2:-1] = [5, 4, 3]  (end index 2 is excluded)
# lst[5::-1] = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
# lst[:2:-1] = [5, 4, 3]

(print "lst =" lst)
(print "lst[5:2:-1] =" lst[5:2:-1])
(print "Should be [5, 4, 3]")

# The issue is my code includes the end index for negative step
