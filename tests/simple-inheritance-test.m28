# Simple test for inheritance with debug

# 1. Create base class
(class Base nil)
(print "Base class created")

# 2. Create derived class with correct syntax
# Need Base in a list format that matches what the parser expects
(class Derived Base)
(print "Derived class created")

# 3. Test issubclass
(print "Derived issubclass of Base:" (issubclass Derived Base))
(print "Base issubclass of Derived:" (issubclass Base Derived))
(print "Base issubclass of Base:" (issubclass Base Base))
(print "Derived issubclass of Derived:" (issubclass Derived Derived))
