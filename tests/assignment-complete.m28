# Comprehensive assignment test

# Property assignment
(= obj {"x": 1})
(= obj.x 10)
(= obj.y 20)
(print "Property assignment:" obj)

# Nested property assignment
(= data {"user": {"scores": [10 , 20 , 30]}})
(= data.user.name "Alice")
(print "\nNested property:" data)

# Index assignment - lists
(= lst [1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5])
(= lst[0] 100)
(= lst[-1] 500)
(print "\nList index assignment:" lst)

# Index assignment - dicts
(= d {"a": 1})
(= d["b"] 2)
(= d["a"] 10)
(print "\nDict index assignment:" d)

# Mixed property and index assignment
(= data.user.scores[1] 200)
(print "\nMixed assignment:" data)

# Assignment in expressions
(= x 0)
(if (= x 42)
    (print "\nAssignment in if condition: x =" x)
    (print "This shouldn't print"))

# Multiple assignments in sequence
(= a 1)
(= b (= a 2))
(print "\nMultiple assignments: a =" a ", b =" b)

# Test assignment with different types
(= lst[1] "string")
(= lst[2] {"nested": "dict"})
(print "\nMixed types in list:" lst)

# Edge cases - assignment errors happen at evaluation time
# so they can't be caught with try/except in the same expression

(print "\nAll assignment tests passed!")
