; Test different ways to specify parent classes

; 1. Create a base class
(class BaseA nil) 
(print "BaseA created")

; 2. Try different ways to create derived classes
(print "\nTrying different parent specifications:")

; Option 1: Single parent directly
(class DerivedA1 BaseA)
(print "DerivedA1 created")

; Option 2: Single parent as a list 
(class DerivedA2 (BaseA))
(print "DerivedA2 created")

; Option 3: nil parent (should result in no parent)
(class DerivedA3 nil)
(print "DerivedA3 created")

; Create second base class for multiple inheritance test
(class BaseB nil)
(print "BaseB created")

; Option 4: Multiple parents in a list
(class MultiDerived (BaseA BaseB))
(print "MultiDerived created")

; Test issubclass with these different variations
(print "\nTesting inheritance relationships:")
(print "DerivedA1 issubclass of BaseA:" (issubclass DerivedA1 BaseA))
(print "DerivedA2 issubclass of BaseA:" (issubclass DerivedA2 BaseA))
(print "DerivedA3 issubclass of BaseA:" (issubclass DerivedA3 BaseA))
(print "MultiDerived issubclass of BaseA:" (issubclass MultiDerived BaseA))
(print "MultiDerived issubclass of BaseB:" (issubclass MultiDerived BaseB))
