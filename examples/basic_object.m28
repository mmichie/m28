# Basic object test
# This demonstrates a very simple object-like structure

# Create a simple object with a few methods
(= obj (dict))

# Add a method directly
(def (say-hello name)
  (+ "Hello, " name "!"))

# Add the method to the object
(= obj (dict "greet" say-hello))

# Test printing the object
(print "Object: " obj)

# Get the method from the object and call it
(= greet-fn (get obj "greet"))
(print "Method type: " (type greet-fn))
(print "Result: " (greet-fn "World"))
